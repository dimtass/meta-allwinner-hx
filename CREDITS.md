I would like to thank all the developers for their contribution to
improve this meta BSP layer. As a reminder, this layer is not an
original work and its based on [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/)
and the [meta-sunxi](https://github.com/linux-sunxi/meta-sunxi) layer.

The reason that I didn't contribute on the meta-sunxi layer and I've
chosen to create a new one, is that the changes that I wanted to
introduce, would never been accepted. I wouldn't accepted them either.
meta-sunxi is a great and very clean layer, which follows the Yocto
workflow. On the other hand, this layer is a hack as it uses the
Armbian's patching system and patches for the bootloader and the kernel.
This makes it easier to add new boards and update the BSP.

Therefore, all credits go to armbian and meta-sunxi developers for
sharing their amazing work and it was possible to create this layer.
